# Predicting-Energy-consumption-using-smart-meters-in-London
In the 
modern century, smart meters are used to store the electricity 
consumption data from different sources. In this project, we will 
be exploring the data mining and data analytics techniques to 
predict the energy consumption using smart meter records in 
London. In addition to the energy consumption records, we will be 
analysing if weather and holiday data affects the energy 
consumption. So, K-Means clustering is performed to create the 
weather clusters and then SARIMAX model is used for 
forecasting. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) has been used to 
evaluate the model’s performance. In addition, Dickey Fuller’s 
Test will be used to check whether a unit root is used in the 
SARIMAX model.
